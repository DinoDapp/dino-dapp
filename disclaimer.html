<h2>Cryptocurrency Disclaimer</h2>

<p>CARDINO, the game accessible from <a href="https://cardino.io">https://cardino.io</a>, is named as a portmanteau
    between Cardano and Decentralized In Name Only. This is due to the web assembly implementation of the edutainment
    application that integrates with the Cardano blockchain.</p>

<h3>What does this mean?</h3>

<p>
    The entirety of the code is running within your browser and is as secure as the device you are using to access it.
    We do not store any of your data on a centralized server because we do not have any "back end" server code.
    We do deploy to a mesh network of edge nodes from a somewhat centralized source so there is limited attack surface.
    All transactions will be negotiated through smart contracts using Plutus and will never require you to send ADA
    insecurely to any address directly.
</p>

<h3>Why does this matter?</h3>

<p>
    If either your device or our source code becomes compromised by a malicious actor they could substitute elements of
    the application.
    This could be for minor nuisances such as cheating the game locally or more serious criminal activity such as
    attempting to compromise transactions.
    ALWAYS verify EVERY transaction before signing and submitting to a blockchain because without centralized
    authority there is no way to rewrite history.
</p>

<h3>Who are we?</h3>

<p>
    Technology enthusiasts that are interested in a more secure and fair financial framework than what has been provided.
    Education is also a primary interest and in need of a systematic change that is less commercial and more community.
</p>

<p><strong>WE WILL NEVER ASK FOR ADA, PROVIDE A WALLET ADDRESS, OR EVER CONTACT YOU WITHOUT YOUR REQUEST!</strong></p>
<p><strong>WE WILL NEVER SHILL, PROMOTE, GIVEAWAY, OR OTHERWISE PROVIDE ANY FINANCIAL INCENTIVE, ADVICE, OR SWEEPSTAKES!</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6God9Xtzuqs">Charles Hoskinson on the Anti-Scam Group within Cardano Foundation</a></p>

<p>If anyone ever contacts you claiming otherwise it is almost certainly a SCAM.</p>
<p><strong>DO NOT, repeat DO NOT EVER send ANY amount of cryptocurrency to an address you did not explicitly request and
    verify!</strong></p>

<p>We are not here to make money. This is a self-funded project that has been operating at a loss since inception.
    We are here to educate, enlighten, and hopefully entertain as well.
